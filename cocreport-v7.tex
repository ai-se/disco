The longevity of parametric effort estimation     is remarkable.
Decades after their invention, these methods are still
both 
widely used and widely useful.

This paper
reviews the standard criticisms of this approach.
We find that, contrary to common criticisms,  
(1)~parametric
estimation has not been superseded by more recent estimation methods;
(2)~it is not true that parametric estimation is no better
than simplistic lines of code counts;
(3)~the old parametric calibration
data is still relevant to more recent projects; 
%XXX check if this list is still current
 (4)~parametric estimation need not be expensive to deploy  at some new site
since these these methods can be tuned on
very small sample sizes (in our experiments,
a mere eight projects is enough);
 and 
 (5)~compared to other methods,
 parametric estimation is not unduly sensitive to errors in the size estimates.

Hence we conclude that,  in 2015, is still valid and recommended practice to try parametric estimation
before exploring other, more innovative methods. Also, it  can be useful
to augment parametric estimation with (a)~some local calibration 
and (b)~some column pruning (examples of those techniques are discussed in this paper).

\section{Introduction}
Accurately estimating software development
effort  is of vital
importance. 
Under-estimation leads to schedule and budget
overruns and, perhaps, project
cancellation~\cite{CLCS03}.  Over-estimation slows
the deployment of promising ideas and
organizational competitiveness~\cite{koc11a}.
%XXX history of parametric models learned via regression
It is hence not surprising that there is long history
of researchers exploring software effort estimation, dating back to the 1970s\footnote{e.g. \cite{wol74,frei79,putnam76,black77,herd77,watson77,jensen83,park88,boehm81,Walkerden1999,shepperd97,jorgensen05,me06d,burgess01}}.
In 2007, Jorgensen and Shepperd
reported on hundreds of research papers devoted to
the topic, over half of which propose some innovation
for developing new estimation
models~\cite{jorgensen05}. Since then,
many more such papers have been published\footnote{
e.g. \cite{lokan06,cora10,minku14,Li2007,Li2009a,keung2008a,keung2008b,keung2008c,koc11b,me12a,me13a,kocaguneli2014transfer}}.


In the 1970s and 1980s, this kind of research was focused on
{\em parametric estimation} as done 
by Putnam and
others~\cite{wol74,frei79,black77,herd77,watson77,boehm81}. For example, Boehm's
COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO)
model~\cite{boehm81} 
 assumes  that effort varies exponentially on size as seen in this parametric form:
$\mathit{effort} \propto \mathit{a \times KLOC}^b$. To deploy this equation in an organization,
local project data is used to tune the  $(a,b)$ parameter values, If local
data is unavailable, new projects can reuse prior tunings, perhaps with some minor
tweaks~\cite{me04h}. 


%XXX what if not in cocomo format. answer : then use something else. caution:
%XXX the results thos this paper suggest that if possible, better estimates might be obtained from
%XXX starting with cocomo- but this is uaully a domain descision (sometimes local experts
%just prefer using their local in-house descriptors.

Since the early work on parametric estimation, other researchers
have innovated other estimation methods based on
regression
trees~\cite{shepperd97}
case-based-reasoning~\cite{shepperd97}, spectral
clustering~\cite{me12d}, genetic
algorithms~\cite{cordero97,burgess01}, etc.  These methods
can be augmented with  ``meta-level'' techniques like tabu search~\cite{cora10}, feature selection~\cite{chen05}, instance selection~\cite{koc11b},
feature synthesis~\cite{me12a}, active learning~\cite{me13a}, transfer learning~\cite{kocaguneli2014transfer}.
temporal learning~\cite{lokan09,minku14}, and many more besides.

%% This paper comments on a curious disconnect between the academic research and the commercial effort estimation industry.

%% in the software effort
%% estimation is one of the oldest, most enduring,
%% research themes in SE
%% Effort estimation is still the focus
%% of much research activity.  
%% Since the 1970s, one of us (Boehm) has lead an large consortium
%% of researchers building and revising the
%% COnstructive COst
%% MOdel (COCOMO) model. First published in 1981~\cite{boehm81},
%% the model was updated to COCOMO-II~\cite{boehm00b}. A newer COCOMO-III model is also
%% currently
%% under development~\cite{rosa14}. 


In her keynote address to ICSE'01, Mary Shaw~\cite{shaw01} noted that it can take up to a
decade  for  research innovations
to become stable and then another decade after that to become
widely popular\footnote{See slide3 of her slides at goo.gl/tfi3D6.}. Given that, it would be reasonable
to expect commercial adoption of  the 1990s estimation work
on  regression trees~\cite{shepperd97} or case-based-reasoning~\cite{shepperd97}.
This has not happened:
\bi
\item
Based on our knowledge of the Chinese and United States software industry,
we assert that  industry, government labs, or professional societies
make almost exclusive
use  parametric estimation tools such as those offered by 
Price Systems (pricesystems.com) and  Galorath (galorath.com).
\item
Parametric estimation is
widely-used, especially across the aerospace
industry and various U.S. government agencies. For example,
NASA routinely checks  software estimates 
in  COCOMO~\cite{dabney07}.  
\item
Professional societies, handbooks and
certification programs have developed around the use
of these parametric estimation methods and tools such as ICEAA
(the
International Cost Estimation and Analysis Society: 
iceaaonline.com), along with workshops such as the
NASA Cost Symposium (goo.gl/8jxPrb) and the
International Forum on COCOMO and Systems/Software
Cost Modeling (goo.gl/O01Pc6).
\ei
To explain this puzzling lack of adoption of more innovative
effort estimation methods, we make the following conjecture:
the case has not been made that \#1~parametric estimation {\em is no longer useful} 
and that 
\#2~the supposedly more
innovation methods are {\em comparatively  more useful}.
Since the case for \#1 and \#2 is missing in the literature,
we choose to  explore these two issues.

For that task,
we used COCOMO since its
internal details have been fully
published~\cite{boehm00b}. Also, several COCOMO data
sets are readily available
which we used to   answer five research questions:

{\bf RQ1: Is parametric estimation no better than
  just using simple Lines of Code measures?}  
This is an often heard, but rarely tested,
criticism.

{\bf RQ2: Has parametric estimation been superseded
 by more recent estimation methods?}  We 
 apply our ``best-of-breed''
learner, published in recent IEEE TSE paper, to some
recent NASA data. We also comparatively assess
case-based reasoning and regression trees.



{\bf RQ3: Are the old parametric tunings irrelevant
  to more recent projects?}  We apply the old
COCOMO-II tunings from 2000, with and without local
tweaking, to a wide range of projects dating from
1970 to 2010.

{\bf RQ4: Is parametric estimation expensive to deploy  at some new site?}
We experiment with tuning estimation models on very small training sets 
as well as simplifying the specification of local projects.

{\bf RQ5: Are parametric estimates unduly sensitive to errors in the size estimate?}
In the context of RQ4, when we are using very small training sets, we check what happens
if there are large errors in the KLOC estimate.

The answer to all of these research questions was
``no''; i.e.   this paper fails to prove \#1 and \#2.
Instead, we showed that
the continued
use of parametric estimation can still be endorsed.

We believe this result has strong implications for current practice
in effort estimation research. 
Specifically: it must be asked to what extent we
can count on newer innovative techniques for effort estimation.  
Small training sets are very common in software estimation studies\footnote{
For example, five recent  effort estimation
publications~\cite{Mendes2003,Auer2006,baker07,koc11a,Li2009} used tables of data with
13,15,31,33,52 rows (respectively).}.
This small quantity,
 as well as the unique and highly variable characteristics of SE
project data place great limitation on the results
obtained by naively applying some brand-new
algorithm.  What COCOMO, or other parametric
estimation models, can offer largely contains the
backbone structure for making estimation decisions
from expert-delphi, as well as well calibrated
tuning factors from over 40 years of
industrial data. Perhaps the best future direction is to
investigate how innovative new techniques can extend
(rather than replace) existing and successful
estimation methods.  Some experiments in this paper
are a starting point for that investigation.


\section{Background}

\subsection{Delpi- vs Model-based Estimation}

There are two broad classes of software effort
estimation: {\em delphi-based methods}  use
human experts while {\em model-based  methods} such as parametric estimation
(a)~build a model using old data then (b)~use the
model to generate estimates for new projects. 

Once a
large software project has been divided into
multiple small stories, Delphi-based methods can be
remarkably accurate~\cite{molokk08}. However, for {\em initial} large-scale
estimates, the Delphi approach has some problems.
Passos et al. show that many
commercial software engineers generalize from their
first few projects to all future
projects~\cite{passos11}.
Also, Jorgensen \& Gruschke document how
  commercial estimation ``gurus'' rarely use lessons
  from past projects to improve their future estimates~\cite{jorgensen09}. 
When engineers
  fail to revise their beliefs, this leads to poor
  Delphi-based estimates  (see examples in~\cite{jorgensen09}).

\subsection{COCOMO: Origins and Development}
These concerns with  Delphi  date
back many decades and were the genesis for  COCOMO. In 1976, Robert Walquist (a TRW division general manager)
told  Boehm: \begin{quote}{\em ``Over the last three
weeks, I've had to sign proposals that committed us
to budgets of over \$50 million to develop the
software.  In each case, nobody had a good
explanation for why the cost was \$50M vs. \$30M or
\$100M, but the estimates were the consensus of the
best available experts on the proposal team.  We
need to do better. Feel free to call on experts
\& projects with data on previous software cost.''}\end{quote}

TRW had a previous model that worked well for a part
of TRW’s software business~\cite{wol74}, but it
did not relate well to the full range of embedded
software, command and control software, and
engineering and scientific software involved in
TRW’s business base.  Having access to experts and
data was a rare opportunity, and a team involving
Ray Wolverton, Kurt Fischer, and Boehm conducted a
series of meetings and Delphi exercises to determine
the relative significance of various software cost
drivers. Using combining local expertise  and data, plus some prior results 
such as~\cite{putnam76,black77,herd77,watson77},  and early versions of the RCA
PRICE S model~\cite{frei79}, a model called SCEP was created (Software Cost
Estimation Program).
Except for
one explainable outlier, the model’s estimates for
the 20 projects with solid data were within 30\% of
the actuals, with most within 15\% of the actuals.


%%  and worked with projects to gather uniform
%% software cost driver and effort data on its 1970s
%% large software projects.  The data definitions were
%% based on TRW’s waterfall-model based software
%% development policies and standards. They also
%% benefited from a concurrent surge in publications
%% describing software cost estimation models such as~\cite{putnam76,black77,herd77,watson77} and early versions of the RCA
%% PRICE S model~\cite{frei79}.
%% SCEP  became standard practice for
%% large TRW projects; and a TRW Office of Software
%% Cost Estimation was established to provide its usage
%% support, training, data collection and analysis, and
%% evolution, which continues to this day.


%% The conclusion for that work
%% was that a reasonably accurate model could
%% be developed, but that proposals and projects should
%% complement its results with expert-judgment based
%% estimates, and reconcile their results where
%% necessary.  
%% It was given the name SCEP, for Software Cost
%% Estimation Program; its use along with expert
%% judgment estimates became standard practice for
%% large TRW projects; and a TRW Office of Software
%% Cost Estimation was established to provide its usage
%% support, training, data collection and analysis, and
%% evolution, which continues to this day.

%% SCEP was highly successful in proposal and
%% management use, but it was proprietary to TRW and
%% could not be used by customers to evaluate other
%% companies' cost estimates.  Thus, TRW became
%% receptive to having a version that generalized
%% beyond TRW experience but was still accurate for
%% TRW.  

After  gathering some further data from subsequent
TRW projects and about 35 projects from teaching
software engineering courses at UCLA and USC along
with commercial short courses on software cost
estimation, Boehm was able to gather 63 data points
that could be published and to extend the model to
include alternative development modes that covered
other types of software such as business data
processing.  The resulting model was called the
COnstructive COst MOdel, or COCOMO, and was
published along with the data in the book Software
Engineering Economics~\cite{boehm81}. 
In COCOMO-I, project attributes
were scored using just a few coarse-grained values (very low,
low, nominal, high, very high). These attributes
are {\em effort multipliers} where
a off-nominal value changes the estimate by some number
greater or smaller than one.
In COCOMO-I, all attributes (except KLOC)
influence effort in a linear manner.

Following the release of COCOMO-I Boehm created a consortium for
industrial organizations using COCOMO .
The consortium
collected information on 161 projects from commercial,
aerospace, government, and non-profit organizations.
Based on an analysis of those 161 projects, Boehm
 added  new attributes called {\em scale factors}
that had an {\em exponential impact}
on effort (e.g. one such attribute was process maturity).
 For a full description of the COCOMO-II attributes,
see \fig{cparems}.

Using that new data, Boehm and his colleagues developed
the  {\em tunings} shown in \fig{coc2} that
map the project descriptors (very low, low, etc)
into the specific values used in the COCOMO-II model
(released in 2000~\cite{boehm00b}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cocII}
\mathit{effort}=a\prod_i EM_i *\mathit{KLOC}^{b+0.01\sum_j SF_j}
\end{equation}
Here, {\em EM,SF} denote the effort multipliers and scale
factors and
 $a,b$ are the {\em local calibration} parameters (which in COCOMO-II
have default values of 2.94 and 0.91).
Also, {\em effort}
measures ``development months'' where one month
is 152 hours work by one developer (and includes development and management hours).
For example, if {\em effort}=100, then according to COCOMO,
five developers would finish
the project in 20 months.

\end{figure}

Recent changes in the software industry
suggest  it is time  to revise COCOMO-II.
The rise of agile methods, web
services, cloud services, parallelized software on
multicore chips, field-programmable-gate-array
(FPGA) software, apps, widgets, and net-centric
systems of systems (NCSOS) have caused the COCOMO II
developers and users to begin addressing an upgrade
to the 14-year-old COCOMO II. 
Current discussions
of a potential COCOMO III have led to a
reconsideration of the old COCOMO 1981 development
modes, as different development phenomena appear to
drive the costs and schedules of web-services,
business data processing, real-time embedded
software, command and control, and engineering and
scientific applications\footnote{
Efforts to characterize
these modes and to gather data to calibrate models
for dealing with them are underway, and contributors
to the definition and calibration are welcome.}.  


\subsection{COCOMO and Local Calibration}\label{sect:coconut}
When there is insufficient 
data to generate the exact tunings of \fig{coc2}, 
a {\em local calibration} procedure can be used.
Local calibration adjusts the impact of the scale factors and effort
multipliers by tuning the  $a,b$ values of Equation~\ref{eq:cocII}
(while keeping constant the other values of the tuning matrix
shown in \fig{coc2}).

Menzies' preferred local calibration procedure is the COCONUT
procedure of \fig{coconut} (first written in 2002
and first published in 2005~\cite{me04h}). 
For some number of {\em repeats},
COCONUT will {\em ASSESS} some {\em GUESSES} 
 for $(a,b)$ by applying them to some
{\em training} data. If any of these guesses prove to
be {\em useful} (i.e. reduce the estimation error) then COCONUT will recurse after
{\em constricting} the guess range for $(a,b)$ by some amount (say, by $2/3$rds). COCONUT terminates
when (a)~nothing better is found at the current level of recursion
or (b)~after 10 recursive calls-- at which point the guess range
has been constricted to  $(2/3)^{10}\approx 1$\% of the initial range.

\subsection{Choice of Data}\label{sect:data}
For this study we used all the COCOMO data available to the authors
(see \fig{types}).
The COC81 and NASA93 data comes
from the PROMISE repository\footnote{https://promisedata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/effort/}:
\bi
\item COC81 is the original data from 1981 COCOMO book;
\item NASA93 is data collected at  NASA  in the early 1990s
 about software that supported  the planning activities for the International
Space Station.
\ei
The other data
sets come from more recent data collections by the COCOMO team (COC05) or by NASA's
effort estimation team (NASA10).  These COC05 and NASA10 data sets are proprietary and, as such,
cannot be released to the rest of the research community. For information on the kinds
of projects included in these two data sets, see \fig{types}.

As shown in \fig{types}, the data tables of NASA10, COC81, NASA93, and COC05
contain information on 17, 63, 93, and 95  projects, respectively.
As to the attributes of that data, all the projects contain the COCOMO attributes of 
\fig{cparems}.




\subsection{Choice of Experimental Rig}


``Ecology inference''
is the conceit 
that what holds for all, also holds for parts 
of the population~\cite{posnet11,me12d}.
For the purposes of avoid ecological inference,
our  rig runs separately for each data set (see Figure~\ref{fig:rig}).

For the purposes of repeatability, we use
leave-one-out experiments 
i.e. for every project, the learner is offered a training
set containing all other projects. For a justification of leave-one-out
vs other methods (e.g. n-way cross-validation), see~\cite{koc13a}.



Since some of our methods include a stochastic
algorithm (the COCONUT algorithm of \fig{coconut}),
we repeat the leave-one-out experiments $N=10$ times
(10 was selected since, after experimentation, we
found our results looked the same at $N=8$ and
$N=16$).

The performance of the estimate for each project was
assessed via the magnitude of the relative error; i.e. 
\mbox{$ \mathit{MRE}=\frac{abs(\mathit{actual} - \mathit{predicted})}{\mathit{actual}}$}. 
Shepperd \& MacConnell~\cite{shepperd12a} propose
another measure that reports the performance as a
ratio of some other, much
simpler, ``straw man'' approach (they recommend the
mean effort value of $N>100$ random samples of the
training data). At first, we used the Shepperd \&
MacDonnel approach for this work but found that
their straw man had orders of magnitude larger error
than all the results shown here. Hence, we adopt the
spirit, but not the letter, of their proposal and
compare all our results against the LOC(n) ``straw
man'' method discussed below.

     print rank(mres) # some statistical tests
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The experimental rig used in this paper.}\label{fig:rig}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Choice of Learners}\label{sect:whatlearn}

 Our LOC(n) ``straw man'' 
estimators ignore all attributes except for lines of code
in the $n$ nearest projects\footnote{For distance,
we use the standard Euclidean measure recommended for
instance-based reasoning by Aha et al.~\cite{aha91};
i.e. $\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i-y_i)^2}$ where $x_i,y_i$ 
are values normalized 0..1 for the range min..max}. For $n>1$,
we weight estimates via the triangle 
function of  Walkerden
and Jeffery~\cite{Walkerden1999}; 
e.g.. for $loc(3)$, the  estimate
from the first, second, third closest neighbor with estimates
$a,b,c$ is 

{\footnotesize
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tri}
\mathit{effort} = (50a + 33b + 17c)/100
\end{equation}}
Apart from the LOC ``straw man'',
we also compare COCOMO-II and COCONUT with CART
and Knear(n). 
CART is an {\em iterative dichotomization} algorithm
that finds the attribute that most divides the data such that
the variance of the goal variable in each division is minimized.
The algorithm then recurses on each division. 
Finally, the cost data in the leaf divisions
is averaged to generate the estimate. 

Knear(n) estimates a new project's effort
by a nearest neighbor  method~\cite{shepperd97}. Unlike LOC(n),
a Knear(n) method uses all attributes
(all scale factors and effort multipliers as well as lines of code)
to find the {\em n-th} nearest projects in the training data. 
Knear(3) combines efforts from three nearest neighbors using
Equation~\ref{eq:tri}.
Knear(n) is an example of CBR; i.e.  {\em case-based reasoning}.
CBR for effort estimation was 
first pioneered by Shepperd \& Schofield
in 1997~\cite{shepperd97}.
  Since then, it 
has been used extensively in software effort
estimation~\cite{Auer2006,Walkerden1999,%
  Kirsopp2002,shepperd97,kadoda00,Li2008,Li2006,Li2007,Li2009a,
  keung2008a,keung2008b,keung2008c}.  
There are several reasons  for this. Firstly, 
it works even if the domain data is sparse~\cite{Myrtveit}.
Secondly, 
unlike other predictors, it makes no assumptions about data
distributions or some  underlying parametric model. 

In defense of our selection of CART and case-based
reasoners like Knear(n):
\bi
\item 
Recall Shaw's comments listed in the introduction. 
If it takes decades before research work becomes popular
in industry, then it makes most sense for this study to
explore innovative effort estimation methods that at least
a decade old, or more. Two such methods are CART and Knear(n).
\item
Several papers have concluded
that CART and Knear(n)
are useful comparison algorithms for effort
estimation-- see Figure~\ref{fig:kcart}.
\ei
\begin{figure}[!t]
{\small
\begin{tabular}{|p{.95\linewidth}|}\hline
Recent studies published in IEEE
TSE~\cite{keung2008b,me13a,dejaeger12}
endorse
CART as a state-of-the-art effort estimation method.  These
studies assert that in terms of assessing new effort
estimation methods, existing methods such as CART's
regression tree generation may be more than
adequate, e.g.~ Dejaeger et al. found little
evidence that learners more elaborate than CART
offer a significant value-added~\cite{dejaeger12}.

Our own results endorse the conclusions of
Dejaeger et al. 
Recently we studied 90
effort estimators. These were  combinations of 10
pre-processors and 9 learners to build ensemble
methods~\cite{koc11a}).  As it might have been
predicted by Myrtveit et al.~\cite{myrtveit05}, the
ranking of the estimators varied greatly.
However, we found a small group of 13 estimators
(all variants of CART and Knear(n) aided with
pre-processors) that were consistently the best
performing methods across a range of experimental rigs.

%% Finally, one more learner is explored, just to handle
%% a possible criticism of this work. This paper
%% reports that a COCOMO method works best on four data sets
%% that were all collected using the COCOMO ontology.
%% ``Of course COCOMO does best,'' says this particular
%% criticism, ``since all the test cases are already
%% written in COCOMO''.  To test this, we need a rather
%% particular experimental method: (1)~a data set where

%XX threats to validity

%% Our final experiment 
%% check if the results of this paper are just due
%% to COCOMO-based learners being applied to COCOMO data
%% (see \tion{other}). Hence, we 
%% needed one more learner that was more representative
%% of recent work than CART or Knear(n). 
%% Such a learner is the 
%% SLOPE algorithm of Papakroni~\cite{papa13}.
%% SLOPE
%% is a non-parametric response surface method that generates estimates for a project by

%%  This interpolation is weighted by the
%% distance to each centroid (and the estimate from
%% the closer centroid has more weight, see \fig{slope}).
%% That is,  SLOPE is any example of a {\em prototype learner}~\cite{chang74}
%%  that replaces $N$ examples with $M \ll N$ most informative ``prototypes'' (in this case,
%% the cluster centroids).
%% Prototype learners mitigate for data outliers since 
%% noisy outliers disappear from the prototypes~\cite{chang74}.
%% In an extensive study,
%% Papakroni~\cite{papa13} found that SLOPE's predictions where (1)~ competitive
%% with random forests and  Naive Bayes (for defect prediction)
%% and (2)~regression trees and linear regression (for effort estimation).

\subsection{Choice of Statistical Ranking Methods}
The last line of our experimental rig shown in
\fig{rig} {\em rank}s multiple methods for learning
effort estimators.
This study ranks methods using the Scott-Knott
procedure recommended by Mittas \& Angelis in their 2013
IEEE TSE paper~\cite{mittas13}.  This method
sorts a list of $l$ treatments with $ls$ measurements by their median
score. It then
splits $l$ into sub-lists $m,n$ in order to maximize the expected value of
 differences  in the observed performances
before and after divisions. E.g. for lists $l,m,n$ of size $ls,ms,ns$ where $l=m\cup n$:


{\footnotesize
\[E(\Delta)=\frac{ms}{ls}abs(m.\mu - l.\mu)^2 + \frac{ns}{ls}abs(n.\mu - l.\mu)^2\]}
Scott-Knott then applies some statistical hypothesis test $H$ to check
if $m,n$ are significantly different. If so, Scott-Knott then recurses on each division.
For example, consider the following data collected under different treatments {\em rx}:


{\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
        rx1 = [0.34, 0.49, 0.51, 0.6]
        rx2 = [0.6,  0.7,  0.8,  0.9]
        rx3 = [0.15, 0.25, 0.4,  0.35]
        rx4=  [0.6,  0.7,  0.8,  0.9]
        rx5=  [0.1,  0.2,  0.3,  0.4]
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
After sorting and division, Scott-Knott declares:
\bi
\item Ranked \#1 is rx5 with median= 0.25
\item Ranked \#1 is rx3 with median= 0.3
\item Ranked \#2 is rx1 with median= 0.5
\item Ranked \#3 is rx2 with median= 0.75
\item Ranked \#3 is rx4 with median= 0.75
\ei
Note that Scott-Knott found  little
difference between rx5 and rx3. Hence,
they have the same rank, even though their medians differ.

Scott-Knott is preferred to, say, hypothesis testing
over all-pairs of methods\footnote{e.g. Six treatments
can be compared $(6^2-6)/2=15$ ways.
A 95\% confidence test run 15 times total confidence 
$0.95^{15} = 46$\%.}.
To avoid an all-pairs comparison, Scott-Knott only calls on hypothesis
tests {\em after} it has found splits that maximize the perfromance differences.
 
For this study, our hypothesis test $H$ was a
conjunction of the A12 effect size test of  and
non-parametric bootstrap sampling; i.e. our
Scott-Knott divided the data if {\em both}
bootstrapping and an effect size test agreed that
the division was statistically significant (99\%
confidence) and not a ``small'' effect ($A12 \ge
0.6$).

For a justification of the use of non-parametric
bootstrapping, see Efron \&
Tibshirani~\cite[p220-223]{efron93}.
For a justification of the use of effect size tests
see Shepperd\&MacDonell~\cite{shepperd12a}; Arcuri\&Briand~\cite{arcuri11}; Kampenes~\cite{kampenes07}. These researchers
warn that even if an
hypothesis test declares two populations to be
``significantly'' different, then that result is
misleading if the ``effect size'' is very small\footnote{For
example, Kocaguenli et al.~\cite{kocharm13} report on the misleading
results of such hypothesis tests in software defect
prediction (due to small size of the effect being
explored).}.
Hence, to assess 
the performance differences 
we first must rule out small effects.
Vargha and Delaney's
non-parametric 
A12 effect size test 
explores
two lists $M$ and $N$ of size $m$ and $n$:

{\footnotesize \[A12 = \left(\sum_{x\in M, y \in N} 
\begin{cases} 
1   & \mathit{if}\; x > y\\
0.5 & \mathit{if}\; x == y
\end{cases}\right) / (mn)
\]}
This expression computes the probability that numbers in one sample are bigger than in another.
This test was recently 
endorsed by Arcuri and Briand
at ICSE'11~\cite{arcuri11}.

\subsection{COCOMO vs Just Lines of Code}\label{sect:justloc}
This section explores {\bf RQ1:
is parametric estimation no better than 
using simple lines of code measures?}

An often heard, but not often tested, criticism of parametric
estimation methods is that they are no
better than just using simple lines of code measures.
As shown in \fig{loc}, this is not necessarily true.
This figure is a comparative ranking for LOC(1)
LOC(3), COCOMO-II and COCONUT.
The rows of \fig{loc} are sorted by the median MRE figure.
These rows are divided according to their 
 {\em rank}, shown in the left column: better methods
have {\em lower rank} since they have {\em lower MRE} error values.
The right-hand-side column displays the median error (as a black dot)
inside the inter-quartile range
(25th to 75th percentile, show as a horizontal line).

The key observation in \fig{loc}
is that it is {\em not} the case that just using lines of
code does better than parametric estimation.
Also, when LOC(n) goes wrong, it goes very
wrong indeed (as seen in the COC81 results, over
double the median MRE error generated by COCOMO-II).

Another observation from \fig{loc} is that,
measured in terms of median MRE, COCONUT's local
calibration is not  better
than  untuned COCOMO. In only one data set
(NASA93) did COCONUT have a lower median MRE than
COCOMO-II but even in that case, Scott-Knott
declared there was no significant difference between
the COCOMO-II and COCONUT results.

On the other hand, sometimes the local calibration
results exhibited far less variance than those of
COCOMO-II. For example, in \fig{loc}'s COC05
results, the IQR ranges for
COCOMO-II and COCONUT were 146 and 34 respectively.
This result (that local calibration reduces
variance) repeats enough times in the subsequent
experiments to make us recommend local calibration
as a method for taming high variance in effort
estimation.

\subsection{COCOMO vs Other Methods}\label{sect:othermethods}
This section explores {\bf RQ2: 
has parametric estimation been superseded
by more recent estimation methods?}
Also explored is {\bf R3: Are the old parametric tunings irrelevant to
more recent projects?}

\fig{standard} shows a comparison of more standard effort estimation methods.
(this figure is in the same format as \fig{loc}).
Many of the results of \fig{standard} repeat observations seen previously.
For example,  nothing was ever ranked better than COCOMO-II
(sometimes
CART or COCONUT had a slightly lower median MRE but that difference was small: $\le 4$\%).
From this result,
we recommend that effort estimation researchers take care to benchmark
their new method against older ones.

As to COCONUT, this method
was usually ranked equaled to COCOMO-II.  
In once case (NASA10), COCOMO-II and COCONUT were ranked first and second but
the median difference in their scores is very small (42 vs 47).
Also,
many other methods often had much larger variances. 
Hence,  we can recommend some form of local calibration as a variance reduction tool.  

From this data, we conclude that it is not
always true the parametric estimation has been
superseded by more recent innovations such
as CART and Knear(n). Also, the COCOMO-II tunings from 2000
are useful not just for the projects used to make those tunings
(all of COC81, plus some of NASA93)
but also for projects completed up to a decade after
those tunings (in NASA10).

\subsection{COCOMO vs Simpler COCOMO}\label{sect:simpler}
This section explores {\bf RQ4:
is parametric estimation expensive to deploy
at some new site?}. To that end,
we assess the impact
a certain simplifications imposed onto COCOMO-II. 




\subsubsection{Range Reductions}
One cost with deploying COCOMO in a new
organization is the training effort required to generate consistent project
rankings from different analysts. If we could reduce 
the current six
point scoring scale (very low, low, nominal, high, very high and extremely high)
then there would be less scope 
for disagree about projects. 
Accordingly, for this experiment, 
we reduced the  six point scale to just three:
\bi
\item {\em Nominal}: same as before;
\item {\em Above}: anything above nominal;
\item {\em Below}: anything below nominal.
\ei
To do  this, the tunings table of
\fig{coc2} was altered. For each row, all values
below nominal were replaced with their mean (and
similarly with above-nominal values).  For example,
here are the tunings for {\em time} before and after
being reduced to {\em below, nominal, above}:

{\scriptsize   \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|ll|l|lll|}

      range      & vlow&  low&{\em nominal}&high&vhigh&xhigh\\\hline
     before & 1.22& 1.09& 1.00& 0.93& 0.86& 0.80\\
     reduced&1.15& 1.15& 1.00&  0.863& 0.863&0.863\\\cline{2-3}\cline{5-7}
                 & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{{\em below}} &&\multicolumn{3}{c|}{{\em above}}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}}


\subsubsection{Row Reductions}
New COCOMO models are tuned only after collecting
100s of new examples. If that was not necessary, we could look forward to multiple
COCOMO models, each tuned to different specialized (and small) samples of projects.
Accordingly, we explore tuning COCOMO
on very small data sets.

To implement this row reduction, training data was
shuffled at random and training was conducted on
all rows or on just the first four or eight rows rows
(denoted {\em r4,r8} respectively). Note that, given  the positive
results obtained with {\em r8} we did not explore larger training sets.

\subsubsection{Column Reduction}

Prior results tell us that row reduction should be
accompanied by column reduction.  A study by Chen et
al.~\cite{chen05a} combines column reduction (that
discards noisy or correlated attributes) with row
reduction. Their results are very clear: as the
number of rows shrink, {\em better} estimates come
from using {\em fewer}
columns. Miller~\cite{miller02} explains  why this is so:  the variance of a
linear model learned by minimizing least-squares error decreases as the number of columns in the model
decreases. That is, as the number of columns decrease,
prediction reliability can increase (caveat: 
if you remove too much,
there is no information left for predictions).

Accordingly, this experiment sorts the attributes in the training set according
to how well they select for specific effort values. 
Let $x\in a_i$ denote the list of unique values seen for attribute $a_i$. Further,
let there be $N$ rows in the training data; 
let  $r(x)$ denote the $n$ rows containing $x$; and let $v(r(x))$ be the variance
of the effort value in those rows. The values of ``good'' attributes
select most for specific efforts; i.e. those attributes minimize:

{\small \begin{equation}\label{eq:fss} E(\sigma,a_i) =\sum_{x\in a_i} \frac{n}{N}v(r(x))\end{equation}}
This experiment sorted all training data attributes by $E(\sigma,a_i)$ then kept
the data in the {\em lower quarter} or  {\em half} or {\em all} of  the columns
(denoted {\em c0.25} or {\em c0.5} or {\em c1} respectively).
Note that, due to the results of \fig{loc}, LOC was excluded from column reduction.

\subsubsection{Results}

\fig{fss} compares results found when use either
{\em all} or some {\em reduce} set of ranges, rows,
and columns. Note our nomenclature:  the
COCONUT:c0.5,r8  results are those
seen after training on eight randomly selected
training examples reduced to {\em below, nominal,
above}, while ignoring 50\% of the columns. 

In \fig{fss}, all the {\em r4} results are ranked
comparatively worse than the other treatments.  That
is, thse results do not condone learning from just
four projects.

On the other hand \fig{fss} suggests that it is defensible
to learn a COCOMO model from eight projects. All the
{\em r8} results are top-ranked with the exception
of the COC81 results (but even there, the absolutely
difference between the top {\em r8} results are
standard COCOMO is very small).

Overall, \fig{fss} suggests that the modeling
effort associated with COCOMO-II could be reduced. Hence,
it need not be expensive to deploy parametric estimation
at some new site.
Projects attributes
do not need to be specified in great detail:
a simple three point scale will suffice:
 {\em below, nominal, above}. As to how much data is
required for modeling, 
the results
from COCONUT:c0.5,r8 are ranked either the same as
COCOMO-II or (in the case of COC81) fall very close
to the median and IQR seen for COCOMO-II.
That is, 
a mere eight projects can
suffice for calibration.
Hence, it
should be possible to quickly build many COCOMO-like
models for various specialized sub-groups using just
a three-point scale

That said, some column pruning should be employed
when working with very small training sets (e.g.
the eight rows used in \fig{fss}. 
Note that
in all data sets that generated multiple rankings,
the {\em c1} results (that used all the attributes)
were not top-ranked. That is, in a result that might
have been predicted by Miller or Chen et al., when
working with just a few rows it is useful to
reflect on what columns might be ignored.




\subsection{COCOMO with Incorrect Size Estimates}\label{sect:nonoise}

This section explores
{\bf RQ5: Are parametric estimates unduly sensitive to
errors in the size estimate?}


Before endorsing an KLOC-based estimation method,
it is important to understand the effects of noise
within the KLOC samples. 
Test projects to be estimated may have noisy KLOC values if
the development team incorrectly guesstimated the size of
the code.
Training data may have noisy KLOC
for many reasons such as
\bi
\item How was reused code accounted
for in the KLOC?
\item Or were LOC counts based on end-statement
or end-of-line symbols?
\item Or how were lines of comments handled?
\ei
Another factor that introduces noise into training and test
data are systems built from multiple languages. 
To make estimates from  those kind
of systems, KLOC in one language needs to be translated (in a possibly incorrect way) to KLOC in another language.

In theory, the  problem of noisy KLOC measures seem particularly acute in our work.
The core of COCOMO  is an estimate that is exponential on KLOC.
This means that 
 KLOC will be magnified in a non-linear way). 
Also, if we train on just eight rows, as proposed above,
then any noise in that small training data could be highly
detrimental to the estimation process.

On the other hand, the coefficients on the exponential term in  COCOMO equation are not
large: \mbox{$e=b+0.01*\sum_iSF_i$}
where the default value for $b$ is less than one (0.91) and the nominal values for $SF_i$ sum to less than 20.
In that default
case \mbox{$e=0.91+0.01*20= 0.912$} so KLOC errors may not be unduly magnified. However, for other non-default values,
the coefficient is larger ($e_{max}=1.22$) so it is important to check the effects of noise using real-world data.

To check the effects of noise, we repeated the reduction
experiments of the last section while also injecting
noise into the KLOC values.
That is, as above, 
(1)~the ranges were reduced to three;
(2)~half the columns were reduced;
(3)~we trained on only eight randomly selected projects; and 
(4)~prior to train and test, all KLOC values were adjusted
to
\[\mathit{KLOC} = \mathit{KLOC}*((1- n) + (2*n*r))\]
where $n \in \{0.25,0.5\}$ is the level of noise we are exploring and $r$ is a random number
$0 \le r \le 1$.

The results are shown in \fig{noise}. Any result
marked with {\em n/2} or {\em n/4} shows what happens
when the KLOCs were varied by 50\% or 25\% respectively.
In only one case (COC81) were the noisy results statistically
different from using data without noise. That is,
the parametric estimation method being recommended here is
not unduly effected by noise where the KLOC values
vary up to 50\% of their original value.


\input{noise}

\section{Threats to Validity}

The above results were based with certain settings for some experiments on some data. 
For example, in the previous section, we used noise at levels 25\% and 50\%.
Clearly, these results may not hold if a wider range of settings for (e.g.) noise are explored.


%% In the future, we plaIt is reasonable to require
%% that these results be repeated on a 
%% XXX more parametric estiamtion that COCOMO.
%% COCOMO more simialrt to SEER etc than others

%% there are other biases as the analogy guys will point out.  you are only using cocomo parameters.   
%% XXX but that might be the point- that estiamtion is easy is the right data is collected, that
%% effective effort estiaton is a metter of good data colelction rather than in the subsequent analtysis.



Another source of bias in this study
are the learners used for the defect prediction
studies. Data mining is a large and active field and
any single study can only use a small subset of the
known data mining algorithms. The case for the
learners used in this study was made in \tion{whatlearn}.

Questions of validity also arise in terms of how the
projects (data-sets) are chosen for our experiments.
While we used all the data sets that could be shared
between our team, it is not clear if our results
would generalize to other as yet unstudied
data-sets. One the other hand, in terms of the
parametric estimation literature, this is one of the most extensive
and elaborate studies yet published.

On the matter of our data- there is a clear bias in
our sample: all these projects are described in terms of
the COCOMO attributes.  Clearly, when more data
becomes available, collected by different teams, we
plan to repeat this study.% on data from other


That said, it is not clear that the data sets used in this study
were   somehow simplistic or unchallenging. We saw
that (e.g.) the COCOMO-II exhibited very large
variances when applied to the COCO05 data. Further,
supposedly state-of-the art methods had difficulty
with generating good predictions with some of these
data sets (recall the poor CART result for COC81 and
NASA10).  We therefore believe that these data sets
are complex enough to serve as a stress test for
different effort estimation methods.


\section{Conclusion}
The past few decades have seen a long line of innovative  methods
applied to effort estimation. This paper has compared a sample of those methods
to a decades-old parametric estimation method. 

We found that:
\bi
\item {\bf RQ1}: parametric estimation is indeed
better just using LOC (see \tion{justloc}); 
\item {\bf RQ2}: new innovations in effort estimation have not superseded parametric estimation (see \tion{othermethods});
\item {\bf RQ3}: Old parametric tunings are not out-da<ted (see \tion{othermethods});
\item {\bf RQ4}: It is possible to simplify parametric estimation with some range, row and column pruning to reduce the cost
of deploying those methods at a new site (see \tion{simpler});
\item {\bf RQ5}: Parametric estimation methods like COCOMO that assume effort is exponential on lines of code are {\em not} unduly
sensitive to errors in the LOC measure (see \tion{nonoise});.
\ei
Hence, we conclude that in 2015 is still valid and recommended practice to {\em first} try parametric estimation,
perhaps  augmented with a local calibration method like COCONUT
and Equation~\ref{eq:fss}'s  column pruner.


Having made that case, we need to add that in 
practice, approaches like expert judgment~\cite{jorgensen09}  and
playing-poker for agile estimation~\cite{molokk08} have their home
ground, but that is not enough of a reason to reject decades of research into parametric estimation
and 
COCOMO. Best practices and empirical studies
show that different methods can work together to
reduce biases~\cite{yang08aa}. What we hope we have shown here is that it would be useful for those best practices
to {\em include}, and not {\em replace}, parametric estimation.

%%  We hasten to add that these results should not be read
%% as a repudiation of all other research into effort estimation.  
%% The caveat on all our results is that
%% projects are described in terms of the COCOMO
%% parameters.  Where this is not possible, then
%% non-COCOMO methods should be employed. 
%% For example, this paper is a side-effect of a study
%% (funded by NASA)
%% to build a non-COCOMO effort model. 
%% For example, at NASA, 
%% projects are discussed in terms of their development language
%% and mission type (one of ``observatory'', ``rover'', ``deep space satellite'', etc)
%% rather than the standard COCOMO attributes. That projects used numerous state-of-the-art innovations:
%% Spectral learning, principle component analysis, prototype learning,
%% non-parametric response surface methods, and Monte Carlo simulation~\cite{papa13,me12d}.

%% With those innovations, it was possible
%% to build a model performed as well as COCOMO but did not use the COCOMO attributes.
%% On the other hand, that new model {\em did no better} than
%% COCOMO's parametric estimation-- a result that motivated this current paper.
%% The conclusion from that study must be that if 


%% Experience with COCOMO
%% By the mid-1990’s, it was clear that some of the
%% 1981 COCOMO assumptions (waterfall model, fixed
%% diseconomies of scale exponents relating size to
%% effort, aging cost drivers and rating scales) were
%% becoming increasingly invalid.  The USC Center for
%% Software Engineering and its industry and government
%% affiliates established an effort in 1995 to define
%% and calibrate a new model that would address the
%% software cost estimation needs of 21st century
%% projects.  It took 5 years to develop; the resulting
%% 23-parameter model was calibrated to 161
%% well-defined project data points and was published
%% as COCOMO II~\cite{boehm00b}; although its
%% calibration data remained proprietary.  But even
%% during the 5-year development period, the software
%% field was moving sufficiently rapidly to require
%% alternative models to account for such changes as
%% commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)-intensive systems
%% (COCOTS), schedule-optimized rapid application
%% development (RAD) projects (CORADMO), and
%% incremental development, that were published as
%% emerging extensions in the book.

%% The results of this paper show 
%% that COCOMO-II is still comparatively as good as many other methods
%% for effort estimation. 
%% While some of the
%% post-2000 COCOMO II project data points are not
%% well-estimated by the standard COCOMO II model and
%% its coefficients, this problem  can be addressed by
%% local calibration (plus column reduction). 
%% Our best guess is that the current COCOMO-II model (augmented with local calibration)
%% will
%% have a ``half-life'' of a decade or two.

%% That said,
%% recent changes in the software industry, and the above results,
%% suggest  it is time  to revise COCOMO-II.
%% The rise of agile methods, web
%% services, cloud services, parallelized software on
%% multicore chips, field-programmable-gate-array
%% (FPGA) software, apps, widgets, and net-centric
%% systems of systems (NCSOS) have caused the COCOMO II
%% developers and users to begin addressing an upgrade
%% to the 14-year-old COCOMO II. 

%% Current discussions
%% of a potential COCOMO III have led to a
%% reconsideration of the old COCOMO 1981 development
%% modes, as different development phenomena appear to
%% drive the costs and schedules of web-services,
%% business data processing, real-time embedded
%% software, command and control, and engineering and
%% scientific applications.  
%% The above column
%% reduction results suggest that it should not be too difficult to calibrate
%% COCOMO-III to various specialized areas.

For example, as discussed here,
it is possible to use WHERE to generate COCOMO estimates
even if the project  data does not include the COCOMO
attributes.

To explain this example, we start as follows.
At NASA, it is a required management
practice to audit software effort estimates using COCOMO.
One complexity with that process is
that NASA developers often describe their projects using some
descriptors other than COCOMO. For example, at the NASA, 
projects are discussed in terms of their development language
and mission type (one of ``observatory'', ``rover'', ``deep space satellite'', etc).

To bridge between these project descriptors and the
 COCOMO attributes, NASA's estimation team conduct a study where,
for a sample of 18 projects, they augmented with NASA descriptors
with the COCOMO values. Using that data it was possible
to certify that it is possible to generate estimates as good as COCOMO,
 even without the direct use of the COCOMO model. 

That collected data had columns for COCOMO attributes as well as the NASA-specific descriptors:

{\scriptsize\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc|cccc}
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{COCOMO attributes}&\multicolumn{3}{c}{NASA descriptors}\\\hline
Year& LOC& flex& ... &Language& MissionType& ...\\\hline
1998& 108& 2 & ... & C& Observatory& ... \\
1999&314& 3  & ... & C& Rover& ... \\
2000&224& 3 & ... & C&  DeepSpace& ... \\
2001&50& 3 & ... & C&  DeepSpace&  ... \\
2002&597& 4 & ... & C& Rover& ...  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}}

From the above data, WHERE generated various clusters.
Note that the range of COCOMO attributes in each cluster is different:
rover missions (in cluster \#1) have a large range for LOC and development
flexibility.

{\scriptsize\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc|cccc}
     &\multicolumn{4}{c}{COCOMO attributes}&\multicolumn{3}{c}{NASA descriptors}\\\hline
cluster&Year& LOC& flex& ... &Language& MissionType& ...\\\hline
\#1&1999&314& 3  & ... & C& Rover& ... \\
&2002&597& 4 & ... & C& Rover& ... \\\hline
\#2&1998& 108& 2 & ... & C& Observatory& ... \\
&2000&224& 3 & ... & C&  DeepSpace& ... \\
&2001&50& 3 & ... & C&  DeepSpace&  ... 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}}

Using this structure, it is now possible to use COCOMO to
generate estimates for a new project $P$, even if that
project is 
expressed in the NASA descriptors:
\be
\item 
Using the NASA descriptors, find the cluster that is nearest
to the new project $P$. 
\item Note the cluster's ranges $R$ for COCOMO attributes. 
\item
Sample a COCOMO model 1000 times using inputs
selected at random from the ranges $R$. 
\item
Return the median
value seen in step 3.
\ee
This
kind of Monte Carlo analysis~\cite{woller96} is standard practice in the 
COCOMO community.
It is used when there is some uncertainty in the inputs
(for more
details, see Baker~\cite{baker07}). For the purposes of reference, we will call this Monte Carlo approach SAMPLE:


\begin{lstlisting}
def SAMPLE(data,project):  
   clusters  = WHERE(data)
   neighbors = distances(project,clusters) 
   cluster1  = neighbor[0] # closest neighbor
   ranges    = COCOMO values seen in cluster1
   for i in range(1000):
     inputs = random selections from ranges
     estimates[i] = COCOMO2(inputs)
   return sorted(estimates)[500] # median value
\end{lstlisting}

Note that in the above code,  {\em distances()} uses a Euclidean
$dist()$ function that relies only  on  the NASA descriptors.
That is, once these clusters have been learned, it is possible to
apply it to future NASA projects that are expressed in terms of the COCOMO attributes.

Aha et al.~\cite{aha91} warn
of four problems with CBR:   they are 
intolerant of irrelevant attributes (\#1)
and  attribute noise (\#2);
they are  computationally expensive since all inference
must scan all saved training instances (\#3);
they offer little usable information on the structure of the data (\#4).
To explain that last point, note that CBR  stores  the training data as
dots in some box. If the user asks for any generalizations from the data, then
all the analyst can do is show them the dots in the box.
COCOMO, on the other hand, 
generates a succinct equation that comments on the relationship between each attribute
and the final effort. 

%%% 9:13 ==> 10:23
%%% 5873 ==> 8530
To address the above, Menzies et
al. proposed WHERE~\cite{me11m}:
\be
\item

\item
 
\item
If subsequent reasoning is restricted to
just the prototypes, then this mitigates for problem
\#3 since (a) during training, fewer examples are
stored and (b) during testing, fewer examples are
searched.
\item
As to problem \#4, WHERE reduces effort
estimation data to six (or less) prototypes~\cite{papa13,me12c}. 
Business users can rapidly read such
succinct summaries.

$b_i$ & A bag of results for one treatment $i$. E.g.
 $loc(3)$ from \fig{loc}.\\\hline
$n_i$  & The performance scores in $b_i$.
E.g. all  MRE values of  $loc(3)$.\\\hline
\rowcolor{Gray}
$B$ & A list of bags $B=\{b_1,b_2,...\}$ that stores
the same performance score for different treatments, sorted on $b.i$'s mean score. E.g. the 
{\em loc(1), loc(3), COCONUT, and COCOMO-II} results

\rowcolor{Gray}
$B.\mu$ & Mean of the scores in all bags $b_i \in B$.\\\hline
Procedure & Divide a  list of bags $B$ into two lists $B_1$ \& $B_2$ by finding the division
that maximizes the expected value of the sum of square of the mean dfferences  before and after divisions; i.e.
\[\frac{|B_1|}{|B|}abs(B_1.\mu - B.\mu)^2 + \frac{|B_2|}{|B|}abs(B_2.\mu - B.\mu)^2 \]
Recursively divide the two   sub-bags,
terminating when
statistical tests report that
the performance scores in the two divisions are insignificantly
different. For this work our hypothesis tests used
the non-parametric bootstrapping method recommended by Efron \& Tibshirani~\cite[p220-223]{efron93}, combined with the A12 effect size test of \tion{a12}.
For pragmatic reasons (to reduce runtimes), the bootstrap
is only run {\em after} checking the A12 results.

Return & A sorted set of groups of bags of treatments.
>Each group contains
treatments that are indistinguishable. Treatments are ranked
by the numeric order of their group.\\\hline
Example & Here are five results from five treatments:

\begin{verbatim}
rx1 = [0.34, 0.49, 0.51, 0.6]
rx2 = [0.6,  0.7,  0.8,  0.9]
rx3 = [0.15, 0.25, 0.4,  0.35]
rx4=  [0.6,  0.7,  0.8,  0.9]
rx5=  [0.1,  0.2,  0.3,  0.4]
\end{verbatim}
After Scott-Knott, then:
\bi
\item Ranked \#1 is rx5 with median= 0.25
\item Ranked \#1 is rx3 with median= 0.3
\item Ranked \#2 is rx1 with median= 0.5
\item Ranked \#3 is rx2 with median= 0.75
\item Ranked \#3 is rx4 with median= 0.75
\ei
Scott-Knott found  little
difference between rx5 and rx3. Hence,
they have the same rank, even though their medians differ.
